# Hangman-Guess_the_word

This the well known game "Hangman" or otherwise known as "Guess the word". Created using Python3.0 and Turtle for the animations and hints for the user.
The game is to be played amongst two parties. (Individual or teams)

The gameflow goes in this way:
1. Player1 enters a word of his choice in the python console, that will then be guessed by Player2.
2. Player2 then takes over the console, and tries guessing the entered word.
3. Player2 is allowed at most 8 wrong guesses/ tries, after which he will lose by default. And on each wrong guess, an animation in the turtle screen would draw a part of an ambulance.
4. However, guessing the word with less than 8 wrong guesses will result a Win for Player2.
5. After the game ends, it can be restarted by pressing another key.

Good luck! Have Fun!!!
